<!-- title: Mixins and AOP; order: 18 -->
# Concept

The design of **Mixins** and **AOP** is meant to write highly re-useful code 
that suits for many scenarios and you don't have to expand your class.

## Horizontal Inheritance (Mixins)

**Mixins** allows you inherit methods and properties from multiple classes 
instead of only the supper class. To use mixins, you will need to install 
another package [class-mixins](https://github.com/hyurl/class-mixins), you 
should check out its documentation to be more understood of it features.

```typescript
// <SRC_PATH>/mixins/CheckUserState.ts
import { HttpController } from "sfn";

export class CheckUserState extends HttpController {
    private loggedIn: boolean;

    async ensureLogin() {
        if (this.loggedIn) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

```typescript
// <SRC_PATH>/controllers/User.ts
import { HttpController } from "sfn";
import { Mixed } from "class-mixins";
import { CheckUserState } from "../mixins/CheckUserState";

export default class extends Mixed(HttpController, CheckUserState) {
    async display() {
        await this.ensureLogin();
        // ...
        // be aware that this instance is an instance of HttpController, but 
        // not of CheckUserState, so
        console.log(this instanceof HttpController); // true
        console.log(this instanceof CheckUserState); // false
    }
}
```

## Aspect Oriented Programming

**AOP** is an important part in an SFN application, an it is very easy to 
achieve. To use this feature, you just need to install another package named 
[function-intercept](https://github.com/hyurl/function-intercept).

```typescript
import { HttpController, before, after } from "sfn";
import { interceptAsync } from "function-intercept";

export default class MyController extends HttpController {
    private loggedIn: boolean;

    @interceptAsync<MyController>().before(async function () {
        // the `this` in this function reference to the controller instance
        // ...
        if (!this.loggedIn) {
            this.res.redirect("/login");
            // returning `false` to prevent invoking the main method.
            return false;
        }
    }).after(async function () {
        // this function will be called after the method has been called
    })
    async display() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The above example only shows you how to directly set intercepter functions upon 
the method via the decorator. But most times you would want to defined the 
function that can be reused in many scenarios.

```typescript
import { HttpController } from "sfn";
import { interceptAsync } from "function-intercept";

export function checkLogin(this: HttpController) {
    // ...
    if (!this["loggedIn"]) {
        this.res.redirect("/login");
    }
}

export default class extends HttpController {
    @interceptAsync().before(checkLogin)
    display() {
        // ...
    }
}

export class AnotherController extends HttpController {
    @interceptAsync().before(checkLogin)
    show() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Other than directly calling `before` and `after`, you can define any functions 
to use as decorators as you want, and for convenience, you can define the 
intercepter function as decorator and manually call `before` and `after` inside 
it, please check the example of module 
[sfn-validate-decorator](https://github.com/hyurl/sfn-validate-decorator).

## Plugins

Plugin is another way to implement AOP in a software. By using plugins, one can 
easily write pluggable and extendable components to manipulate objects without 
having to modify any source code.

Since version 0.5.x, SFN introduces new internal plugin support, and based on 
Alar framework for hot-reloading and auto-loading. But unlike the modules Alar 
proxified, plugins do not need to create instance, and all existing plugins will
be loaded into the system when start up. All plugins should be located in path
`src/plugins/`ã€‚

```typescript
// src/plugins/user.ts
import { Plugin } from 'sfn';
import Axios from "axios";
import User from "../models/user";

declare global {
    namespace app {
        namespace plugins {
            namespace user {
                const onAdd: Plugin<object, User>;
            }
        }
    }
}

// You can bind any number of handler functions to the corresponding plugin in 
// order to achieve some goals. e.g.

// assign user name
app.plugins.user.onAdd.bind((input, user) => {
    user.name = input.name || "Joe";
});

// check if email is available
app.plugins.user.onAdd.bind(async (input, user) => {
    if (input.email) {
        // check email via a remote service
        let url = `https://somewhere.com/email-test?email=${input.email}`;
        let res = await Axios.get(url);
        let ok = res.data.ok;

        if (!ok) {
            throw new Error("user email is invalid or unsupported.");
        }

        user.email = input.email;
    }
});
```

You can apply the plugin in an HttpController (or anywhere you want).

```typescript
// src/controllers/api/user.ts
import { HttpController, Request, route } from "sfn";

export default class extends HttpController {
    static baseURI = "/api";

    @route.post("/user")
    async add(req: Request) {
        // apply the plugin and handle data in the plugin instead of doing it 
        // in the controller.
        let data = req.body || {};
        let user = app.models.user.create();

        user = await app.plugins.user.onAdd.invoke(data, user);

        return user.save();
    }
}
```

### Internal Plugin Interface

SFN reserved a plugin interface `lifeCycle`, used to control all activities
related to server startup and shutdown, also you can add your own logic to this 
interface, to open or close some activity during startup and shutdown. The
following example comes from the SFN website itself.

```typescript
// src/logger-server.ts
// Try to safely close the logger service.
app.plugins.lifeCycle.shutdown.bind(async () => {
    await app.services.logger.instance(app.services.local).close();
});
```

Plugins are hot pluggable components, if you want to add a new function inside 
some procedure, you just need to bind a new handler on the plugin interface, and
if you want to remove some function, you just need to remove that corresponding 
handler from the plugin interface, and take advantage of the hot-reloading 
feature to automatically apply any changes. By doing this, you're able to write 
highly extendable software by just building a plugin system that covers all the
entries of your program life cycle.
